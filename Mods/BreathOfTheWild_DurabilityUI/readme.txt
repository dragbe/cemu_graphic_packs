(2) Moon Slayer = bloody day for tomorrow, base power for the Moon Slayer
(3) Moon Slayer++ = WM_BloodyMoonTimer < 360.0, true form power for the Moon Slayer before and after a blood moon (max 48 minutes)
(4) Moon Slayer+ = full moon night, true form power for the Moon Slayer
This moon slayer doesn't exist yet
